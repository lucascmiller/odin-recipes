            <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>

            <li>1 homemade pizza dough</li>
            <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno, thinly sliced (remove seeds for less spice)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <p>To make the pineapple:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>On a stovetop, heat oil in a cast iron pan on high heat.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, cover the pineapple with honey, lime juice, and a dash of hot sauce and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>When oil is hot, cook on medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes each side. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>To make the pizza:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees (or see notes for cooking pizza on the grill.)</li>
            <li>Roll out pizza dough to desired thickness and shape (I use a 10 inch cast iron pan.)</li>
            <li>Pour marinara sauce on and evenly coat the pizza dough with the back of a spoon or spatula. Top with shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Add sliced jalapeno and grilled pineapple from step 1.</li>
            <li>Bake at 475 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is browned.</li>
        </ol>
